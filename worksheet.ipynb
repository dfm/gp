    "In this tutorial, we'll work through an example problem in Gaussian process (GP) regression using Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is designed to be open-ended and the last sections should be instructive even if you're already familiar with the implementation of GPs.\n",
    "I've chosen to use Python because it is my programming language of choice and because it is commonly used in astronomy, but if you don't have experience coding in Python I've tried to include a lot of skeleton code so you should still be able to make progress without getting too caught up with Python's syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll work through how to fit a simplified transit model to data in the presence of \"correlated noise\".\n",
    "I think that it's important to clarify what I mean by \"noise\" here because it isn't necessarily what you immediately expect.\n",
    "When I say noise, I'm referring to *everything that contributes to generating the data that isn't an exoplanet transit*.\n",
    "In the context of transit fitting, this means that everything that the spacecraft is doing (pointing and temperature variations, etc.) and everything that the star is doing (rotation, asteroseismic oscillations, granulation, etc.) is \"noise\".\n",
    "As you can imagine, in many cases this noise might actually be the thing that you're trying to measure and that's fine – I spend most of my time measuring noise!\n",
    "Therefore, more formally, \"noise model\" refers to anything that we're modeling as **stochastic** and the \"mean model\" refers to anything that we're modeling as **deterministic**.\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we're not going to interpret the stochastic component of the signal and, instead, focus on studying the mean model, but that is not a limitation of GP modeling in general.\n",

    "## 2 – Using GPs in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we developed a fully-functional GP code that you could now use for research, but it might be better to use an existing software package that makes it easier to try out different models and some other niceties.\n",
    "There are packages in every programming language but, if you use Python as your programming language of choice, there are a few different software packages that you can use.\n",
    "Here are a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [george](http://dan.iel.fm/george) – Written (by me!) with astronomy in mind. Good for general purpose GP modeling.\n",
    "2. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html) – Well supported package with a big community. Can be used for astronomy projects with some work.\n",
    "3. [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) – Very flexible with state-of-the-art inference algorithms designed by machine learning researchers.\n",
    "4. [PyMC](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/GP-introduction.html) – Implementation in the context of Hamiltonian MCMC sampling.\n",
    "5. [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) – Like PyMC, a Hamiltonian MCMC sampler with GP support.\n",
    "6. [celerite](http://celerite.readthedocs.io/) – Scalable GP likelihood calculations for 1D datasets (e.g. time series).\n",
    "7. etc. – I'm sure that there are others that I've missed!\n",

    "## 3 – Choosing a kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this tutorial, we chose to use the exponential-squared kernel function for the experiements.\n",
    "This was a good idea because it is *exactly* the kernel that I used to generate the data.\n",
    "That being said, in The Real World™, we never know what kernel to use and there are some other commonly used functions.\n",
    "One good simple example is the Matern-3/2 function\n",

    "$$\n",
    "k_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(r_{ij}) = a^2 \\, \\left[1+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\,|\\Delta x_{ij}|}{l}\\right]\\, \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\,|\\Delta x_{ij}|}{l} \\right )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Try implementing this function (or another one of your choice; see [Chapter 4](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW4.pdf) of [R&W](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/) for examples) and re-run the analysis with this kernel.\n",
    "There is no included unit test for this kernel (since this is an optional extension) bu‘t you might consider making some plots or writing your own tests to make sure that the function returns sensible values."
